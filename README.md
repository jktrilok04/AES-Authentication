# AES-Encrypted Authentication System

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a simple authentication system using **AES encryption (CBC mode)** to securely store and validate user credentials. It features a **terminal-based user interface** built with `ncurses`, allowing users to enter their **username and password** and verify their credentials securely.

## 🎯 Features

- **AES-128 Encryption**: Securely encrypts and decrypts user credentials.
- **CBC Mode Encryption**: Prevents pattern recognition in ciphertext.
- **Terminal-Based UI**: Uses `ncurses` to create an interactive authentication interface.
- **Login System**: Verifies credentials against stored encrypted values.
- **Secure Memory Handling**: Ensures no plaintext credentials remain in memory longer than necessary.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure your system has the following installed:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**
- **`ncurses` library**

#### Install dependencies:

**For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based systems):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

**For macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ncurses
```

**For Windows:**  
Use **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** or an IDE like **Code::Blocks**.

### 2️⃣ Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aes-authentication.git
cd aes-authentication
```

---

### 3️⃣ Compilation

Run the following command to compile the project:

```bash
gcc -o cryptography_app oldschool.c aes.c -lncurses
```

---

### 4️⃣ Running the Program

After compilation, execute the program:

```bash
./cryptography_app
```

---

## 📌 Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Enter your **username** and **password**.
3. If the credentials match the stored encrypted values, you will be authenticated successfully.
4. If incorrect credentials are provided, access will be denied.

**Default Credentials (for testing)**  
- **Username:** `username12345678`
- **Password:** `1234567812345678`

⚠️ *These credentials are hardcoded for demonstration and should be replaced with dynamic storage in production.*

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **AES Key and IV Initialization**  
   - The program initializes an AES context with a **16-byte encryption key and IV**.

2. **Credential Encryption**  
   - The default username and password are **encrypted** and stored in memory.

3. **User Authentication**  
   - The user inputs their username and password.
   - The input is encrypted and compared with stored encrypted credentials.
   - If they match, authentication succeeds; otherwise, it fails.

---

## 💡 Improvements & Future Enhancements

- ✅ Implement **dynamic key generation** instead of hardcoded keys.
- ✅ Support **hashed password storage** instead of encryption.
- ✅ Store credentials securely using **databases** instead of in-memory storage.
- ✅ Implement **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for added security.
